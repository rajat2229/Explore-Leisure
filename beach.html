                When in doubt, go Goa!  One cannot really go wrong with India’s party capital.
                A place where people can be seen sunbathing, swimming, parasailing or relaxing in their hammocks sipping a cold beer all year round, Goa is my first pick. In fact, Goa is the best place to kick-start your beach blast in advance with Sunburn Goa this December! Sunburn is when a conglomerate of party mongers and DJs from all over the world get together at the Candolim beach for the grandest New Year beach party. Late night parties,
                hypnotic music and people dancing away; Sunburn exponentially increases the fun quotient.

            <p class="description">
                Gokarna in Karnataka is situated 190 kilometres south of Goa and makes for a wonderful change from 
                Goa’s fast pace! Famous for the Mahabaleshwar temple and its pristine beaches, in this tranquil town, you can enjoy a day basking in the sun or laying in a hammock reading a book without distractions. Gokarna is well-connected to major cities through buses and trains and the closest airport is Dabolim Airport in Goa.  Though an important pilgrimage site, Gokarna blends religion with beach fun. Om Beach, Paradise Beach and Half-Moon Beach are the famous ones,
                 which have both fine sand and rocky coasts mostly untouched by commercial activities.
